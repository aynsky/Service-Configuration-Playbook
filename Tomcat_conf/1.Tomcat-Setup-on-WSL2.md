## 1️⃣ Download Tomcat

```bash
cd /opt
sudo wget https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.46/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.46.zip
sudo unzip apache-tomcat-10.1.46.zip
sudo mv apache-tomcat-10.1.46 tomcat10
sudo chmod +x tomcat10/bin/*.sh
```

> ✅ **Note:** verified the URL from the official Apache mirror if not works.
> 
> 💡 **Tip:** WSL2 doesn't have systemd, so we **cannot use** `systemctl start tomcat`.

---

## 2️⃣ Environment Variables

```bash
export CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat10
export PATH=$PATH:$CATALINA_HOME/bin
source ~/.bashrc
```

**What these do:**
- `$CATALINA_HOME` → tells Tomcat scripts where the installation is
- Adding `$CATALINA_HOME/bin` to `PATH` allows running scripts from anywhere
- On real servers, this is usually handled in a service unit or environment file

---

## 3️⃣ Start and Stop Tomcat

```bash
# Start Tomcat
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

# Stop Tomcat
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh
```

- 🌐 Tomcat starts and listens on **http://localhost:8080/**
- 📋 Logs are in `$CATALINA_HOME/logs/catalina.out`

---

## 4️⃣ Common Challenges

### 1. `systemctl` doesn't work in WSL2
**Problem:** Standard systemd commands fail  
**Solution:** Use `startup.sh` and `shutdown.sh` instead

### 2. History expansion with `!` in Bash
**Problem:** When using `echo "<h1>Hello!</h1>"`, Bash throws `event not found`  
**Solution:** Use single quotes: `echo '<h1>Hello!</h1>' > index.html`

### 3. DNF install gives older Tomcat
**Problem:** Package managers often have outdated versions (Tomcat 9 vs Tomcat 10)  
**Solution:** For latest features, manual download is better

## 5️⃣ Folder Structure Overview

```
$CATALINA_HOME/
├── bin/      # Scripts to start/stop
├── conf/     # server.xml, web.xml, users, configs
├── lib/      # Shared libraries (servlet-api.jar)
├── logs/     # Tomcat logs
├── webapps/  # Your deployed apps
├── temp/     # Temp files
└── work/     # Compiled JSPs
```

**Key directories:**
- `webapps/` → where we deploy HTML or servlet apps
- `conf/tomcat-users.xml` → define admin/manager users

## 📝 Notes

This guide is specifically tailored for WSL2 environments where traditional Linux service management isn't available. For production deployments, consider using proper systemd service files or containerization.
